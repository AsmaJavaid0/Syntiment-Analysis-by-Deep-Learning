# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for sentiment analysis, which classifies text (e.g., IMDB movie reviews) as positive or negative. The goal is to understand the end-to-end pipeline of dataset preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and saving.

The project follows best practices by keeping the architecture simple yet effective, making it a strong starting point for anyone learning deep learning for NLP.
